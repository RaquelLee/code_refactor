### Code Refactor for Accessibility and Search Engine Optimization

During this project, I learned how search engine positioning and accessibility are linked: through machine readability! Both screen readers and search engines scan a site's code to interpret and present it to the user in a meaningful way.

### Implementation

#### Accessibility and SEO
* Refactored elements with semantic HTML 
* Logical structuring of elements
* Concise and descriptive title
* Alternative text for images

#### Improvements
* CSS selector and property consolidation
* CSS comments added for maintainability
* Images resized to improve page loading time
* All links functioning properly
